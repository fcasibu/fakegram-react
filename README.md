## Lessons Learned

This is by far the biggest project I've done yet. Using BaaS has taught me the communication between frontend and backend. This is great start for what's coming up next with Node.js. I haven't done any testing on this particular project, but throughout the days, I've always contemplated about it. There's something about it that lets you see from the user's perspective, you test what the user see and what the user interacts with. This is something I should not ignore and will definitely test my projects from now on.

Another thing that I've learned, not so much from this project but from The Odin Project community. It is to stop being stubborn and selfish. Plan out your projects and test your application. Be sure to always take breaks and have fun!
